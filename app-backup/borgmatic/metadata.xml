		borgmatic is simple, configuration-driven backup software for
		servers and workstations. Backup all of your machines from the
		command-line or scheduled jobs. No GUI required. Built atop
		Borg Backup, borgmatic initiates a backup, prunes any old
		backups according to a retention policy, and validates backups
		for consistency. borgmatic supports specifying your settings
		in a declarative configuration file, rather than having to put
		them all on the command-line, and handles common errors.
