		borgmatic is a simple Python wrapper script for the Borg backup
		software that initiates a backup, prunes any old backups according to a
		retention policy, and validates backups for consistency. The script
		supports specifying your settings in a declarative configuration file
		rather than having to put them all on the command-line, and handles
		common errors.
