# Gentoo overlay

My personal overlay.

Most ebuilds are (mostly) trivial updates of the ones from the official [gentoo
portage tree](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/). They have not been
fully tested; use them at your own risk.

To add the repository using layman:
```
layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spekadyon/overlay/master/spekadyon.xml -f -a spekadyon
```
